FAQ Q: What is UniGPT? A: UniGPT is a self-hsoted solution for sharing OpenAI API access without directly sharing the API Key. For game developers, we got Unity Editor Extension which can help with project analysis, asset management and pipeline. For users, they can turn their phone/PC into a small server which is suitable for group studies and brainstorms. Q: Is UniGPT another Discord-like or Siri-like app? A: For standalone client, yes, it is for now. But for Unity Editor, it's more like a IDE. Q: Can UniGPT help me visit OpenAI? A: NO, IT WON'T WORK AS A VPN OR PROXY TO HELP YOU VISIT! You need to figure out a way to let server access OpenAI . Once server can access, the client can access too since all ChatCompletion requests are processed on server-side . Q: How about the license and privacy? A: We support BSD-3-Clause License and no data will be transferred to any third party except OpenAI. This program is only suitable for research and internal projects development . For commercial usage, please contact both OpenAI and me . Q: I want to help with the development/I got suggestion/I want to donate/I got issues with project, is that possible? A: Yes, it is. Please contact me or join the Discord server.
